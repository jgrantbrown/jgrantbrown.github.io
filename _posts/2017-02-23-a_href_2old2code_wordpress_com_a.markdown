Learning to code after 40!

The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.

John Muir
What am I getting my self into?

I have decided to learn how to code and this blog will be my companion.

Let’s set some reference on why this is not suppose to work.

My children help me set-up my iPhoneapple-2eimg
I have not been in an academic environment in over 20+years
My work experience is primarily in the textile industry
Sales and operations has been the focus of my work experience
I don’t know anything about coding!!!
OH and am over 40
Great, now that is out of the way let’s begin!

My e-commerce textile site had grown quite well over the first few years. In what we lacked in understanding of the technology we were using; we made up for in knowledge of textiles. In order to scale you need capital, energy, and a plan to utilize technology. Especially, after your main competitor is bought by Amazon.

We gathered the best resources available to us and had proposals for many next-generation full e-commerce platforms.

And this is my interpretation of how this goes:

So you need a car and bring in a design team. After much discussion you decide on some great ideas. You mention that leather seats are really important to you , and the team explains they have the perfect leather and even recommend a certain stitching. Then further specifications about power windows are brought up. A conversation about the radio continues for which satellite radio is considered. The car needs to be an automatic because I don’t drive a stick. After much discussion and back and forth the design team and I finalize a price.

The deadline is reached and my car is on my driveway. The design team reviews all of the features . Great leather seats, power windows , satellite radio and even heated seats because they said another project needed so it wasn’t a problem to include it.

WOW! This is great I get in the car put the key in the ignition.

It doesn’t start??

I look under the hood and there is no engine. The design team says we never talked about an engine. They are right but I assume a car has an engine!!!

My point is that as a business person relating to technology service companies there always seemed to be a disconnect. I felt like we were speaking another language.

Out of necessity I began to explore some simple html, css, and javascript code to implement on my site. I was mesmerized with the logic and process to learn it.

I hope to expand on how I found Flatiron School as the best path for my journey ….
