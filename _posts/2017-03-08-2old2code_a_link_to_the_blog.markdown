"Not all those who wander are lost ."

J. R. R. Tolkien



In my first post I gave a little background on the why at 40+ I am learning to code. This time I want to explore some of the how I started to learn code.

 

So after a few brief searches I stumbled upon these three sites and began poking around.

W3school
Codeacademy
Codeschool
I was memorized at how quickly you could get a few basic commands and manipulate the screen. It was simple HTML HyperText Markup Language. It was the beginner commands of page layout.

<h1>Heading 1</h1>

<h2> Heading 2</h2>

So when you wrote the page using HTML and saved it as an html file then open the file in a browser POOF. There it was on your screen.

Ok, this may not be ground breaking but you have to start somewhere. If you have read my blog this long you either are a good friend, one of my Flatiron classmates or curious about learning to code. And if your the latter it will not be long before you write your first Hello World! program. Its like the initiation to the coding world.

For me there was so much information available: tutorials, videos, books, docs etc. There is also so many languages. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, PYTHON,SQL, etc....

I began to do HTML tutorials because it was somewhat relevant to my business, but since my software was run on a more complex system and "templates" I couldn't use much of what I learned. For me I read a lot about Javascript and began those tutorials.

IT is overwhelming!!!!

It became clear that I had to focus on something and continued to focus on Javascript. Learning to code is hard, especially at the beginning. Who do you ask, where do you ask?

Google IT!!!

That was my go to coach and I kept getting sent to a website called Stackoverflow. It was great to see there was a community so willing to help, but I was still so early in my adventure the help seemed foreign.

With a little research I read a great article. ( I have to  find and give credit to it ) The gist of it was learning to code can be done just like taking on an exercise routine. You can throw on a pair of sneakers an start a running routine all by yourself. Or you could get together with some friends and began a routine and have some support. Maybe you want to join a gym and use the more advanced equipment. Take it up a notch and sign-up for some classes led by an instructor. OR get a personnel trainer for one-on-one.

The point is the goal is the same but getting the result may come from a very different situation. For me I needed a trainer and a community to succeed. So, my journey to push forward required looking for a structured curriculum. In a future post I will layout a bit about the how I choose Flatiron School.

Thanks for reading...
